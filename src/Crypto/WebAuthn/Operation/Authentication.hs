-- This module implements assertion of the received authenticator response.
-- See the WebAuthn
-- [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-verifying-assertion)
-- for the algorithm implemented in this module.
-- Assertion is typically represented as a "login" or "authentication" action
-- in the front-end.
-- [Section 7 of the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-rp-operations)
-- describes when the relying party must perform assertion. Another relevant
-- section is
-- [Section 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-sample-authentication)
-- which is a high level overview of the authentication procedure.

-- | [Section 6.1.1 of the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-sign-counter)

-- part must do with them. In particular:
--
-- The [signature counter](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signature-counter)
-- 's purpose is to aid
-- [Relying Parties](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#relying-party) in
-- detecting cloned authenticators. Clone detection is more important for
-- authenticators with limited protection measures.
--
-- A [Relying Party](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#relying-party) stores
-- the [signature counter](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signature-counter)
-- of the most recent
-- [authenticatorGetAssertion](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#authenticatorgetassertion)
-- operation. (Or the counter from the
-- [authenticatorMakeCredential](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#authenticatormakecredential)
-- operation if no
-- [authenticatorGetAssertion](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#authenticatorgetassertion)
-- has ever been performed on a credential.) In subsequent
-- [authenticatorGetAssertion](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#authenticatorgetassertion)
-- operations, the
-- [Relying Party](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#relying-party) compares
-- the stored
-- [signature counter](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signature-counter)
-- value with the new
-- `[signCount](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signcount)` value returned in
-- the assertionâ€™s
-- [authenticator data](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#authenticator-data).
-- If either is non-zero, and the new
-- `[signCount](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signcount)` value is less
-- than or equal to the stored value, a cloned authenticator may exist, or the
-- authenticator may be malfunctioning.

--
-- Though this library implements the WebAuthn L2 spec, for origin validation we

-- needed in the wild. See [Validating the origin of a credential](https://www.w3.org/tr/webauthn-3/#sctn-validating-origin)
-- more details.
-- In the simplest case, just a single origin is allowed and this is the 'M.RpId' with @https://@ prepended:
--
-- > verifyAuthenticationResponse (NE.singleton (M.Origin "https://example.org")) ...
--
-- In the more complex case, multiple origins are allowed:
--
-- > verifyAuthenticationResponse (M.Origin <$> "https://example.org" :| ["https://signin.example.org"]) ...
--
-- One might also allow native apps to authenticate:
--
-- > verifyAuthenticationResponse (M.Origin <$> "https://example.org" :| ["ios:bundle-id:org.example.ourapp"]) ...
